# Digital Logic Design I — Verilog Exercises and Simulations

> 🇬🇷 Ελληνική έκδοση: [README_GR.md](./README_GR.md)


This repository contains a collection of Verilog implementations developed as part of a **Digital Logic Design I** course.  
The exercises focus on fundamental concepts of hardware description languages (HDLs), combinational circuit design, hierarchical modeling, and timing analysis.

## 📚 Contents

The repository includes solutions to seven laboratory exercises covering:

- Basic combinational circuits
- Logic gates and testbenches
- Multi-level combinational design
- Structural, dataflow, and behavioral modeling
- Hierarchical design using reusable modules
- Multiplexers and decoders
- Binary comparators with delay analysis
- BCD arithmetic circuits
- Ripple-carry and BCD adders
- Worst-case propagation delay estimation
- ModelSim simulations and waveform verification

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

These implementations demonstrate:

- Writing synthesizable Verilog code
- Creating effective testbenches
- Comparing alternative hardware architectures
- Understanding propagation delay in digital circuits
- Using hierarchical design to manage complexity
- Verifying correctness through simulation
